# Applying 3D Convolutional Neural Networks to Identify Lung Nodules on Chest CT Scans

## Background
Lung Cancer is a 224,000 new cases of lung cancer in 2016 and 158,000 deaths. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Men and Women, accounting for etiology of 1 in every 4 cancer deaths in the United States.

The lifetime likelihood that a man will develop lung cancer in his lifetime is 1 in 14, whereas the risk for a woman is 1 in 17.

The primary method in use by physicians to screen for lung cancer is  radiographic imaging of the Chest using Computed Tomography (CT) scans. This imaging modality makes use of many X-ray images to create a 3-dimensional representation of a patient's chest cavity. Unfortunately, Chest CT scans expose patients to a high level of radiation, on the order of 100-500 times the amount of radiation from a single x-ray.
